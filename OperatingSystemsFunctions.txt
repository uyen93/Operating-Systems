If you have a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you can easily sign into your Mac using your finger. 
You get decent mail clients, calendars, calculators, photo and video viewers and editors, screenshot tools, voice recorders, and web browsers, and apps for maps, cameras, news, weather, and contacts.
Youâ€™ll miss out on syncing machines, voice assistants, app roaming, messages, and a whole lot of other goodies by not signing in.
